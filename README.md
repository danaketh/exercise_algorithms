# Algorithms
Implementation of some basic algorithms in different languages.

## Binary Search Algorithm
## Breadth First Search (BFS) Algorithm
## Depth First Search (DFS) Algorithm
## Merge Sort Algorithm
## Quicksort Algorithm
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
